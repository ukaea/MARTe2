# Building on RPI4 Debian 12 Bookworm with gpp version >=12.2.0

The new gpp version required the following steps to build MARTe2.

Source the shell script in the MARTe2 folder i.e. "source check_gpp_version.sh"
The script should say "Found g++ --version 12.2.0" (or higher)
Because of the 'source' command, the script should also have made an Environment Variable BEFORE_GPP_V12P2P0=0

The 'make' command for MARTe2 and MARTe2-Components must be called from the above same instance of the shell, not a new one, to preserve the environment variable BEFORE_GPP_V12P2P0

Warnings stop the build because -Werror is set. This environment variable causes MakeStdLibDefs.armv8-linux to disable some new gpp warnings as follows:

If BEFORE_GPP_V12P2P0 is 0, MakeStdLibDefs.armv8-linux disregards three new types of compiler warnings which stop build
on g++ 12.2.0 

If BEFORE_GPP_V12P2P0 is 1, the original line in MakeStdLibDefs.armv8-linux is applied (in case builds on older g++ were somehow affected by the above modification)

Apart from the above, note this MARTe2 repo's makefiles contain a minor fix as libGTEST was not being built for armv8. 
The build of libGTEST still throws a warning but it completes, perhaps it does not use the MakeStdLibDefs file.
The "Makefile.cov" files throw warnings throughout the build but these do not stop the build.
